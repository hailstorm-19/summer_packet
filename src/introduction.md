# Introduction

Welcome to the 2024 Summer Workout Packet! This packet takes you through the next 8 weeks and will be a variety of strength, endurance, speed, and agility training. Please be diligent with these workouts; your efforts (or lack thereof) will be noticed. Yet, be patient with yourself! These workouts are not designed to be perfected; rather, they are meant to frame your fitness standards and keep us on track for a competitive season.

### What do I do with this packet?
While the packet is very easy to digitally navigate, I also highly recommend printing it out if possible. Bring it to the gym, bring it to the fields where you train, pack it in your bag on summer vacation, and mark it up with your performance and notes. Ultimately, use it however is best for you.

### Questions?
If anything in this packet doesn't make sense, please do not hesitate to reach out to Coach Morgan! Her contact info is found in all of the email correspondence.
