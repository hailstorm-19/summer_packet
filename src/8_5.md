# Week 8 / Day 5

## Dealer's Choice!
This is a free slot to choose a cross-training activity. Preferably, make this an endurance-related activity. Get a good sweat. It's the end of Week 8, and tryouts are right around the corner! This is the time to pull back off of the intensity so that you enter the week of tryouts with optimal energy levels. Fuel well and hydrate.
